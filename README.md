# Responsive Crochet Shop Website Deployed w/ Docker, GCP, and Azure

## Description
This Flask-based project is a shop website. The options in the navigation bar are clickable and lead to other pages. I primarily made this project to further practice responsive web design, Flask, and SQL after finishing a [Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Informational Website](https://github.com/dnce17/pkmn_md_site).

This repo's files was cloned from the [crochet_shop_site](https://github.com/dnce17/crochet_shop_site) repo. The crochet shop website was originally deployed at [Render.com](Render.com), but I created this repo to also practice deploying applications with Docker, GCP, and Azure.
